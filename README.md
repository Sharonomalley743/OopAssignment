--------------------
DT228 Programming assignment for 1st semester 2nd year.
Student number is C16469614.

###Instructions for use
I have created a control panel for the dark side to monitor the death star.
The first handle on the right of the screen when pulled down brings the death star closer
to the screen for you to monitor it. It also shows on the radar below that how close the death
star is getting to you. The horizontal scroll bar when slid towards the left allows opens
a button above that which allows you to blast from the death star. Then the handle on the 
left of the screen when pulled up scans the death star to see if everything is okay and by the 
looks of the engine monitor everything is fine.

###Brief description of code for assignment
The code I have used is completley my own. I took ideas from class examples and modified them
to make them my own. I used multiple classes and loops. I did alot of drawing through the shapes
ellipse and rect. The code I am most proud of is my shoot class code.
